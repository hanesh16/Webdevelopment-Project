                Designed and implemented SIR Mathematical Model which is an
                artificial simualtion of COVID 19 in optimal condition to
                generate the Training data and used it in a supervised learning
                algorithm to estimate the end time of the ongoing second wave of
                pandemic in different states of India.

                Predicted the Short term price of different cryptocurrencies by
                using python and and Random Foreset Machine Learning Model and
                We had observed the Inequality analysis such as Gini Index and
                K-Values measured from lorenz curve over the closed price of
                cryptocurrencies in an time series.

              <p>
                Developed the Internet relay chat by using Python, where a
                client can connect to a server and can create an chat room and
                can also send messages to the other clients with in the same
                room or another room. We used the concepts of Sockets and mutli
                threading process for parallel connection of clients to the
                server to make the application more efficient.
